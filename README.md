This is just a project that I'm doing to get a through understanding of the MEAN stack.
Right now I plan to make it just a people directory. It should be able to store, retrieve and modify
details of individuals, inclluding their picture. Other users could login to the app and depending
on their privileges, will be able to perfom actions on the database.

I just have a vague idea of what this is going to be. It's just a boring project now.

Looking forward to better learn development using MEAN and to making this project something interesting.
Comments, suggestions, questions and commits are always welcome.

More on how to run this app and use it will be updated after preliminary development stage.
